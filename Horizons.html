    <h1>MASTER HORIZONS AND LAYERS</h1>

{HERE WE INSERT AN IMAGE}

<p>
    The capital letters like H, O, A, E, B, C and R represent
    the master horizons and layers of soils.
    The capital letters are the base symbols to which other
    characters are added to complete the designation.
    Most are genetic soil horizons, reflecting a qualitative
    judgment about the kind of changes that have taken
    place.
    Genetic horizons are not equivalent to diagnostic
    horizons, although they may be identical in soil profiles.
    Diagnostic horizons are quantitatively defined features
    used in classification.
</p>

<h2>H horizon</h2>

<p>
    H horizons are dominated by organic material formed
    from accumulations of undecomposed or partially
    decomposed organic material at the soil surface, which
    may be underwater.
    All H horizons are saturated
    with water for prolonged
    periods, or were once
    saturated but are now
    drained artificially.
</p>

<h2>O horizon</h2>

<p>
    O horizons are dominated by organic material consisting
    of undecomposed or partially decomposed litter, such as
    leaves, needles, twigs, moss and lichens, that has
    accumulated on the surface of either mineral or organic
    soils;
    O horizons are not saturated
    with water for prolonged
    periods.
</p>

<h2>A horizon</h2>

<p>
    Surface or near-surface mineral horizon with some organic
    matter (humus) accumulation, usually with a darker colour
    and/or smaller clay content than underlying horizons.
</p>

{HERE WE INSERT AN IMAGE}

<h2>E horizon</h2>

<p>
    A near-surface mineral horizon characterized by a loss of
    clay, iron, aluminum, or some combination of these; usually
    lighter in color (higher value and/or lower chroma) than the
    overlying A and underlying B.
</p>

<h2>B horizon</h2>

<h4>
    Mineral horizon that formed below an A, E, O or H
    horizon, characterised by one or more of the following:
</h4>

<ul>
    
     ➢ illuvial concentration of silicate clay, iron,
     aluminium, humus, carbonates, gypsum or silica
     (alone or in combination);<br>
     ➢ accumulation of sesquioxides;<br>
     ➢ evidence of removal of carbonates;<br>
     ➢ a structure and/or consistence unlike the horizons
        above and below;<br>
     ➢ stronger colours (higher chroma and/or redder hue) than the horizons above and below.<br>
</ul>

<h2>C horizon or layer</h2>

<p>
    Horizons or layers, excluding hard bedrock, that are little
    affected by pedogenetic processes, and lack properties of
    H, O, A, E or B horizons.
</p>

<h2>R layer</h2>

<p>
    Hard bedrock underlying the soil. Air-dry chunks of an R
    layer when placed in water will not slake within 24 hours.
