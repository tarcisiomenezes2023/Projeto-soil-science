    <h2>Definition of soil</h2>

 <p>Soil, the biologically active, porous medium that has developed in the uppermost layer of <a href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/crust/" target="_blank">Earth’s crust</a>. Soil is one of the principal substrata of life on Earth, serving as a reservoir of <strong style="color: blue; text-shadow: 0px 0px 0px blue;">water</strong> and <strong style="color: green; text-shadow: 0px 0px 0px green;">nutrients</strong>, as a medium for the filtration and breakdown of injurious wastes, and as a participant in the cycling of carbon and other elements through the global ecosystem. It has evolved through weathering processes driven by <strong>biological</strong>, <strong>climatic</strong>, <strong>geologic</strong>, and <strong>topographic</strong> influences.</p>

<p>Since the rise of agriculture and forestry in the 8th millennium BCE, there has also arisen by necessity a practical awareness of soils and their management. In the 18th and 19th centuries the Industrial Revolution brought increasing pressure on soil to produce raw materials demanded by commerce, while the development of quantitative science offered new opportunities for improved soil management. The study of soil as a separate scientific discipline began about the same time with systematic investigations of substances that enhance plant growth. This initial inquiry has expanded to an understanding of soils as complex, dynamic, biogeochemical systems that are vital to the life cycles of terrestrial vegetation and soil-inhabiting organisms—and by extension to the human race as well.</p>

<h2>Why soil matters</h2>

        <h2 style="color: white;">Healthy soil is a dynamic living ecosystem: a complex combination of minerals and organic matter containing air, water, and life.</h2>

<p>Soil is at the bottom of the food chain, yet it is the cornerstone of life on earth. It is critical for terrestrial life: acting as a water filter, nutrient giver, and habitat for billions of organisms that make up a diverse ecosystem.</p>

<p>When it’s healthy, it supplies humans with antibiotics that fight diseases, provides nutrients that feed our crops, and its self-sustaining cycle can regenerate for decades. Healthy soil helps to mitigate climate change by acting as a carbon sink – meaning it stores vast quantities of carbon dioxide and other <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/greenhouse" target="_blank">greenhouse gasses</a> (GHGs) that would otherwise be released. In fact, soil is the second largest carbon sink after the ocean, capturing more CO2 than forests and holding three times more carbon than the Earth’s atmosphere.</p>

<h2>Soil Formation</h2>
    
<p>Also known as <strong>pedogenesis</strong>, is the process of soil genesis as regulated by the effects of place, environment, and history. Biogeochemical processes act to both create and destroy order (anisotropy) within soils. These alterations lead to the development of layers, termed soil horizons, distinguished by differences in <strong>color</strong>, <strong>structure</strong>, <strong>texture</strong>, and <strong>chemistry</strong>. These features occur in patterns of soil type distribution, forming in response to differences in soil forming factors.</p>

<p>Pedogenesis is studied as a branch of pedology, the study of soil in its natural environment. Other branches of pedology are the study of soil morphology, and soil classification. The study of pedogenesis is important to understanding soil distribution patterns in current (soil geography) and past (paleopedology) geologic periods.</p>
